INFO: Assuming you are following the directory structure in the following,
replace `/home/abc` with your own home directory wherever you see it.

## Downloading Binary Distribution

Download [binary release from an Apache
mirror](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/predictionio/<%= data.versions.pio
%>/apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>-bin.tar.gz).

### Verifying Release

Verify binary release using the [signatures and checksums]
(https://archive.apache.org/dist/predictionio/<%= data.versions.pio %>/)
and [project release KEYS](https://www.apache.org/dist/predictionio/KEYS).

```
$ gpg --import KEYS
$ gpg --verify apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>-bin.tar.gz.asc apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>-bin.tar.gz
```

You should see something like this.

```
gpg: Signature made Tue Sep 26 22:55:22 2017 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 7E2363D84719A8F4
gpg: Good signature from "Chan Lee <chanlee@apache.org>" [ultimate]
```

For further information, the [official guide from
Apache](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html) has the most up-to-date
and complete information.

### Installation

Extract the binary distribution and proceed to
[Installing Dependencies](#installing-dependencies).

```
$ tar zxvf apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>-bin.tar.gz
```

## Downloading Source Code

Download [source release from an Apache
mirror](https://archive.apache.org/dist/predictionio/<%= data.versions.pio
%>/apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz).

### Verifying Release

Verify source release using [signatures and checksums]
(https://archive.apache.org/dist/predictionio/<%= data.versions.pio %>/)
and [project release KEYS](https://www.apache.org/dist/predictionio/KEYS).

```
$ gpg --import KEYS
$ gpg --verify apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz.asc apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```

You should see something like this.

```
gpg: Signature made Tue Sep 26 22:55:22 2017 PDT

For further information, the [official guide from
Apache](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html) has the most up-to-date
and complete information.

### Building

Run the following at the directory where you downloaded the source code to build

Apache PredictionIO®. By default, the build will be against

* Scala 2.11.8
* Spark 2.1.1
* Hadoop 2.7.7
* Elasticsearch 5.6.9


```
$ tar zxvf apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
$ cd apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>
$ ./make-distribution.sh -Dscala.version=2.11.12 -Dspark.version=2.4.0 -Delasticsearch.version=6.4.2
```

You should see something like the following when it finishes building
successfully.

```
...
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/sbt/sbt
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/conf/
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/conf/pio-env.sh
PredictionIO binary distribution created at PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```

Extract the binary distribution you have just built.

```
$ tar zxvf PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```

## Installing Dependencies

Let us install dependencies inside a subdirectory of the Apache PredictionIO
installation. By following this convention, you can use
Apache PredictionIO's default configuration as is.

```
$ mkdir PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/vendors
```


### Spark Setup

<%= partial 'shared/install/spark' %>


### Storage Setup

#### <a name="pgsql"></a>PostgreSQL Setup

WARNING: You may skip this section if you are not using PostgreSQL.

<%=partial 'shared/install/postgres' %>

#### HBase and Elasticsearch Setup

##### Elasticsearch Setup

WARNING: You may skip this section if you are not using Elasticsearch.

<%= partial 'shared/install/elasticsearch' %>


##### <a name="hbase"></a>HBase Setup

WARNING: You may skip this section if you are not using HBase.

<%= partial 'shared/install/hbase' %>


In addition, you must set your environment variable `JAVA_HOME`. For example, in
`/home/abc/.bashrc` add the following line:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
```


<%= partial 'shared/install/dependent_services' %>





Now you have installed everything you need!

<%= partial 'shared/install/proceed_template' %>
