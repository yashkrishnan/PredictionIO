## Export Events to Apache Parquet

PredictionIO supports exporting your events to [Apache
Parquet](http://parquet.apache.org/), a columnar storage format that
allows you to query quickly.

Let's export the data we imported in [Recommendation Engine Template Quick
Start](/templates/recommendation/quickstart/#import-sample-data), and assume the
App ID is 1.

```
$ $PIO_HOME/bin/pio export --appid 1 --output /tmp/movies --format parquet
```

After the command has finished successfully, you should see something similar to
the following.

```
root
 |-- creationTime: string (nullable = true)
 |-- entityId: string (nullable = true)
 |-- entityType: string (nullable = true)
 |-- event: string (nullable = true)
 |-- eventId: string (nullable = true)
 |-- eventTime: string (nullable = true)
 |-- properties: struct (nullable = true)
 |    |-- rating: double (nullable = true)
 |-- targetEntityId: string (nullable = true)
 |-- targetEntityType: string (nullable = true)
```
