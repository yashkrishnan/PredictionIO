### Start PredictionIO and Dependent Services

WARNING: If you are using PostgreSQL or MySQL, skip `pio-start-all` and
`pio-stop-all`, and do `PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/bin/pio eventserver &`
instead.

Simply do `PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/bin/pio-start-all` and you
should see something similar to the following:

```
$ PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/bin/pio-start-all
Starting Elasticsearch...
Starting HBase...
starting master, logging to /home/abc/PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/vendors/<%= data.versions.hbase_basename %>/bin/../logs/hbase-abc-master-yourhost.local.out
Waiting 10 seconds for HBase to fully initialize...
Starting PredictionIO Event Server...
$
```

You may use `jps` to verify that you have everything started:

```
$ jps -l
15344 org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster
15409 org.apache.predictionio.tools.console.Console
15256 org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Elasticsearch
15469 sun.tools.jps.Jps
$
```

A running setup will have these up and running:

- org.apache.predictionio.tools.console.Console
- org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster
- org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Elasticsearch

At any time, you can run `PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/bin/pio status`
to check the status of the dependencies.
