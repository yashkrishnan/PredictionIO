You can send these events to PredictionIO Event Server in real-time easily by
making a HTTP request or through the provided SDK. Please see [App Integration Overview](/appintegration/) for more details how to integrate your app with SDK.

Let's try sending events to EventServer with the following `curl` commands (The corresponding SDK code is showed in other tabs).

Replace `<ACCCESS_KEY>` by the Access Key generated in above steps. Note that `localhost:7070` is the default URL of the Event Server.

For convenience, set your access key to the shell variable, run:

`$ ACCESS_KEY=<ACCESS_KEY>`
