### Query Event Server

Now let's query the EventServer and see if these events are imported successfully.

Go to following URL with your browser:

`http://localhost:7070/events.json?accessKey=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>`

or run the following command in terminal:

```
$ curl -i -X GET "http://localhost:7070/events.json?accessKey=$ACCESS_KEY"
```

NOTE: Note that you should quote the entire URL by using single or double quotes when you run the `curl` command.

It should return the imported events in JSON format. You can refer to [Event Server Debugging Recipes](/datacollection/eventapi/#debugging-recipes) for more different ways to query Event Server.
