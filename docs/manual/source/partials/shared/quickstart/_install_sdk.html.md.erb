You can send these events to PredictionIO Event Server in real-time easily by
making a HTTP request or through the `EventClient` of an SDK. You can refer to [App Integration Oview](/appintegration/) for more details later.

The following is sample code of using different SDKs to import the events for this template, which you can refer to when you integrate with your app later.

For quickstart demonstration purpose, a script is provided to import sample data (Please see 4b. Import Sample Data.)
