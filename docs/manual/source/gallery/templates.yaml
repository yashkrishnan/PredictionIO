# Similarity

- template:
    name: Content Based SVD Item Similarity Engine
    repo: "https://github.com/alexice/template-scala-parallel-svd-item-similarity"
    description: |-
      Template to calculate similarity between items based on their attributes&mdash;sometimes called content-based similarity. Attributes can be either numeric or categorical in the last case it will be encoded using one-hot encoder. Algorithm uses SVD in order to reduce data dimensionality. Cosine similarity is now implemented but can be easily extended to other similarity measures.
