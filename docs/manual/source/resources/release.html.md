## Versions

Each PIO release will be versioned: `<MAJOR>`.`<FEATURE>`.`<MAINTENANCE>`

- **MAJOR**: Major releases are not on any particular cadence. Major releases are likely to be
  stable over a long period (one year or more)
- **FEATURE**: We are targeting new feature releases every two months and will include new
  features, improvements and bug fixes
- **MAINTENANCE**: This is reserved for urgent bug fixes on the current release

## Release Cadence

Feature releases will occur every two months. Maintenance releases will be ad-hoc, as needed.

- At the beginning of each release, committers nominate features for the upcoming release
- At end of week, share JIRA link with dev user group to invite comments on the list
- Committers modify the target list as necessary after comments are integrated and assign them to devs
