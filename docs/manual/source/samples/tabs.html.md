This page is used to test the tabs plugin based on [Tabslet](https://github.com/vdw/Tabslet).

<div class="tabs">
  <div data-tab="Ruby" data-lang="ruby">
```ruby
# This is a ruby file.
class MyClass
  def foo
    'bar'
  end
end
```
  </div>
  <div data-tab="Plain">
This is a test of **markdown** inside a tab!

```
// This tab does not have the data-lang attribute set!
$ cd path/to/your/file
```
  </div>
  <div data-tab="HTML" data-lang="html">
```html
<p>Yes you can still use HTML in code blocks!</p>
```
  </div>
  <div data-tab="Test">
```php
Test 0 <>
Test 1 >
Test 3 <
Test 4 ><
Test 5 =>
Test 6 <=
Test 7 <>
<p><b>Test</b></p>
```
  </div>
</div>

## Test Syncing

Here we show a similar set of tabs to test language syncing:

<div class="tabs">
  <div data-tab="Ruby" data-lang="ruby">
```ruby
# This is a ruby file.
class MyClass
  def foo
    'bar'
  end
end
```
  </div>
  <div data-tab="Plain">
This is a test of **markdown** inside a tab!

```
// This tab does not have the data-lang attribute set!
$ cd path/to/your/file
```
  </div>
  <div data-tab="HTML" data-lang="html">
<p>This HTML is <b>hard coded</b>.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-tab="Python" data-lang="python">
```python
# The other group does not have a Python tab.
```
  </div>
</div>

<div class="tabs">
  <div data-tab="Java" data-lang="java">
```Java
// Java code..
```
  </div>
  <div data-tab="HTML" data-lang="html">

  This includes **bold** with Markdown.

  </div>
