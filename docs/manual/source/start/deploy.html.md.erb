Once you have created an engine from a template, it is time to deploy it as a web service. One or more of your applications can then send real-time prediction queries to it.

It takes 6 simple steps to deploy and use an engine:

1. Install and Run PredictionIO
2. Create an Engine by downloading an Engine Template
3. Generate an App ID and Access Key, if you are integrating PredictionIO with a new application
4. Collecting Data
5. Deploy the Engine as a Service
6. Use the Engine

The [QuickStart](/templates/recommendation/quickstart/) of the basic Recommendation template is a great step-by-step guide especially if you are new to PredictionIO.

Of course, you may also browse the QuickStart of other engine templates in the template gallery.
