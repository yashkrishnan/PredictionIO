The first step to create a new engine is to browse [PredictionIO template
gallery](/gallery/template-gallery) where you could find Engine Templates for
all kinds of machine learning tasks. Choose an engine template that matches your
use case the best. You can further customize the engine later if you like.

To download a template, go to the template gallery, pick an engine template and
click its name. You will be redirected to the engine template's GitHub
repository. Clone the engine to your local machine to further customize it.

Please browse the [PredictionIO template gallery](/gallery/template-gallery) to
choose an engine template.
