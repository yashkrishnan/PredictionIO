## What is Apache PredictionIO®?

Apache PredictionIO® is an **open source Machine Learning Server**
built on top of a state-of-the-art open source stack for developers and data
scientists to create predictive engines for any machine learning task. It lets you:

* quickly build and deploy an engine as a web service on production with
  [customizable templates](/gallery/template-gallery);
* respond to dynamic queries in **real-time** once deployed as a web service;
* evaluate and tune multiple engine variants systematically;
* unify data from multiple platforms in batch or in real-time for comprehensive
  predictive analytics;
* speed up machine learning modeling with systematic processes and pre-built
  evaluation measures;
* support machine learning and data processing libraries such as Spark MLLib and
  OpenNLP;
* implement your own machine learning models and seamlessly incorporate them
  into your engine;
* simplify data infrastructure management.

Apache PredictionIO® can be [installed](/install/) as a full machine
learning stack, bundled with **Apache Spark**, **MLlib**, **HBase**, **Akka HTTP**
and **Elasticsearch**, which simplifies and accelerates scalable machine
learning infrastructure management.
