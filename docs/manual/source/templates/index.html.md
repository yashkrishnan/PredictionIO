PredictionIO's [template gallery](/gallery/template-gallery) offers both
official and community contributed Engine Templates for all kinds of machine
learning tasks. You can easily create one or more engines from these templates.

The section contains more detailed documentation of the official templates for
beginner users to get familiar with PredictionIO and examples of how the
templates can be modified for other usages.
