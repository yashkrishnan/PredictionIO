# Project Management Committee Documentation

This outlines the steps for a PMC member to create a new release. More details
and policy guidelines can be found here: http://www.apache.org/dev/release-distribution

## Release Procedure

1. Generate code signing key if you do not already have one for Apache. Refer to
http://apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#generate-key on how to generate a strong code
signing key.
2. Add your public key to the `KEYS` file at the root of the source code tree.
3. Create a new release branch, with version bumped to the next release version.
    * `git checkout -b release/0.15.0`
    * Replace all `0.15.0-SNAPSHOT` in the code tree to `0.15.0`
    * `git commit -am "Prepare 0.15.0-rc1"`
    * `git tag -am "Apache PredictionIO 0.15.0-rc1" v0.15.0-rc1`
4. Push the release branch and tag to the apache git repo.
5. Wait for Travis to pass build on the release branch.
6. Package a clean tarball for staging a release candidate.
    * `git archive --format tar v0.15.0-rc1 >
  ../apache-predictionio-0.15.0-rc1.tar`
    * `cd ..; gzip apache-predictionio-0.15.0-rc1.tar`
7. Generate detached signature for the release candidate.
(http://apache.org/dev/release-signing.html#openpgp-ascii-detach-sig)
    * `gpg --armor --output apache-predictionio-0.15.0-rc1.tar.gz.asc
  --detach-sig apache-predictionio-0.15.0-rc1.tar.gz`
8. Generate SHA512 checksums for the release candidate.
    * `gpg --print-md SHA512 apache-predictionio-0.15.0-rc1.tar.gz >
  apache-predictionio-0.15.0-rc1.tar.gz.sha512`
9. Run `./make-distribution.sh` and repeat steps 6 to 8 to create binary distribution release.
    * `mv PredictionIO-0.15.0.tar.gz apache-predictionio-0.15.0-bin.tar.gz`
    * `gpg --armor --output apache-predictionio-0.15.0-bin.tar.gz.asc
  --detach-sig apache-predictionio-0.15.0-bin.tar.gz`
    * `gpg --print-md SHA512 apache-predictionio-0.15.0-bin.tar.gz >
  apache-predictionio-0.15.0-bin.tar.gz.sha512`
10. If you have not done so, use SVN to checkout
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/predictionio. This is the area
for staging release candidates for voting.
    * `svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/predictionio`
11. Create a subdirectory at the SVN staging area. The area should have a `KEYS` file.
    * `mkdir apache-predictionio-0.15.0-rc1`
    * `cp apache-predictionio-0.15.0-* apache-predictionio-0.15.0-rc1`
12. If you have updated the `KEYS` file, also copy that to the staging area.
13. `svn commit -m "Apache PredictionIO 0.15.0-rc1"`
14. Set up credentials with Apache Nexus using the SBT Sonatype plugin. Put this
in `~/.sbt/1.0/sonatype.sbt`.

  ```
  publishTo := {
      val nexus = "https://repository.apache.org/"
      if (isSnapshot.value)
        Some("snapshots" at nexus + "content/repositories/snapshots")
      else
        Some("releases" at nexus + "service/local/staging/deploy/maven2")
  }

  credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager", "repository.apache.org", "<YOUR APACHE LDAP USERNAME>", "<YOUR APACHE LDAP PASSWORD>")
  ```
15. Run `sbt/sbt +publishLocal` first and then run `sbt/sbt +publishSigned +storage/publishSigned`.
Close the staged repository on Apache Nexus.
16. Send out email for voting on PredictionIO dev mailing list.

  ```
  Subject: [VOTE] Apache PredictionIO 0.15.0 Release (RC1)

19. Repeat steps 6 to 8 to create the official release, and step 15 to publish it.
20. Use SVN to checkout
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/predictionio/. This is the area
for staging actual releases.
21. Create a subdirectory at the SVN staging area. The area should have a `KEYS` file.
    * `mkdir 0.15.0`
    * Copy the binary distribution from the dev/ tree to the release/ tree
    * Copy the official release to the release/ tree
22. If you have updated the `KEYS` file, also copy that to the staging area.
23. Remove old releases from the ASF distribution mirrors.
(https://www.apache.org/dev/mirrors.html#location)
    * `svn delete 0.14.0`
24. `svn commit -m "Apache PredictionIO 0.15.0"`
25. Document breaking changes in https://predictionio.apache.org/resources/upgrade/.
26. Mark the version as released on JIRA.
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/PIO?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page&status=no-filter)
